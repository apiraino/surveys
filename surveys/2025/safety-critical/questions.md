# Rust Language & Ecosystem for Safety-Critical: Project Goals 2026

Hey there! Are you a user of Rust in a safety-critical industry (Automotive, Medical, etc.)? Thanks for taking the time for this survey. Please provide your feedback on features, which, if available, would improve the ability for your company to use the Rust programming language in a safety-critical context.

We will use your feedback to inform which [Rust Project Goal(s)](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/index.html) the [Safety-Critical Rust Consortium](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium) should propose for 2026.

The survey will be open until 2025-12-19, 11:59PM PST.
